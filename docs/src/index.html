    <h1>Sizr Lisp</h1>

    <p>
    Sizr Lisp is a Scheme distribution focusing on the <code>Sizr</code> package, an
    AST transformation toolkit built upon <a href="">Tree-sitter</a>. Sizr Lisp is
    based on <a href="">Chibi Scheme</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    By taking Tree-sitter's existing support for selecting program source sections with
    lisp-ish queries, and then evaluating real Scheme programs in the context of that
    selection, we can write highly dynamic transformations to augment or replace source code.
    </p>

        <p>
        The first thing we need to do to figure out how to do things with our code, is to
        tell Sizr which parts of the code we want to talk about. This the process of
        <em>selecting</em> code. Once we have selected some code, we can then 
        </p>

        <code lang="lisp"><pre>
        (function_definition)
        </pre></code>

        <code lang="lisp"><pre>
        ((function_definition) @func)
        </pre></code>

        <p>
        Note that grouping in the selection language does not follow Lisp semantics.
        In Lisp, <code>(function)</code> has a very different meaning than
        <code>((function))</code>.
        </p>

        <code lang="lisp"><pre>
        ((function_definition) @func)
        </pre></code>

        See <a href="">Tree-sitter's query language documentation</a> for a full description of
        the query syntax. The only difference is that a true lisp can not contain a
        <code>.</code> in arbitrary locations, so in Sizr Lisp you must use the a
        quoted symbol instead, <code>'.</code>.

        <h2 id="workspaces-section">Workspaces</h2>
        <p>
        A workspace is a group of interrelated files on a computer system
        that make up a codebase. They can include program source files, program tooling
        configuration, settings, etc. To Sizr Lisp, these are exposed as a set of files,
        and an environment mapping. Workspaces are important so that sizr can find all
        your code, and, eventually, update references during replacing transformations.

        <h2 id="augmenting-code-section">Augmenting code</h2>
        <p>
        Not only can we select code and replace it, but we can select code and use it to
        generate new code in our <a href="#workspaces-section">workspace</a>.

        <h2 id="sizrs-problem-section">The problem with sizr</h2>
        <p>
        Well, it turns out that while having a uniform query language for multiple languages is
        nice, those languages, especially their grammars, are very different. This means that code
        written for one language in Sizr is often not portable to other languages.

        Blah, blah, blah.
