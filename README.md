# sizr-lisp

a [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) and
[Chibi Scheme](http://synthcode.com/wiki/chibi-scheme) based embedding of
the Tree-sitter query language in a lisp (scheme) with a set of functions that
enable transforming programs.

## Playground

You can play with it in your browser at the
[playground](https://MichaelBelousov.github.io/tree-stitcher/src/playground.html).

## Thanks to the following open source (direct) dependencies

without which this would be impossible.

- [Chibi Scheme](http://synthcode.com/wiki/chibi-scheme)
- [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/)
